    <h1>Facebook Event Creator Help</h1>
    <p>First of all, sorry your on this page because it means that somethings probably not working like you want :) No worries, we&#39;ll get it sorted out. Tip for you: <b>Hover over</b> the large questions marks in the app for quick help. If you <b>click</b> on them they will disappear!</p>
    <h2>Prerequisites</h2>
    <p>You need to have some basic stuff before can even start using this application.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>A facebook account</li>
        <li>A facebook developer account account</li>
        <li>A facebook event page</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Facebook Application Stuff</h2>
    <p>If you created your Facebook developers account for the sole purpose of using it with this application and you don't know <b>"how your app integrates with Facebook"</b>, make sure you select <b>"Website with Facebook Login"</b>.
    You can put any value in there that you want as long as it starts with <b>http://</b>... so just put something like <b>http://myapp.com</b> and you're done.
    </p>
    <h2>Excel Notes</h2>
    <p>Right now, only two columns are supported in Excel:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Column 1: The event name</li>
        <li>Column 2: The event start date</li>
    </ul>
    <p>I would recommend that you set the cells with the date / time values for the events to <b>Date</b> format in excel. You don't have to, but this way if you enter the date and time it will be set correctly.</p>
    <h2>The Login Box is Huge!</h2>
    <p>Ok, here's the deal. Facebook changes things on a regular basis, and I have no way of knowing when they will do that. The current login modal screen is the size it needs to be to keep you from having to scroll all over the place to get to the login controls. Sorry about that. Maybe Facebook will make their modal login page small again at some point.</p>
